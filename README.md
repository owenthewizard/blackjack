# blackjack.py

A simple game of blackjack I made for fun.

Implemented as per the rules on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Rules)

> - If the player is dealt an Ace and a ten-value card (called a "blackjack" or "natural"), and the dealer does not, the player wins and usually receives a bonus.
> - If the player exceeds a sum of 21 ("busts"), the player loses, even if the dealer also exceeds 21.
> - If the dealer exceeds 21 ("busts") and the player does not, the player wins.
> - If the player attains a final sum higher than the dealer and does not bust, the player wins.
> - If both dealer and player receive a blackjack or any other hands with the same sum, this will be called a "push" and no one wins.

## Features

- Automatic computer players
- Multiple human players
- Unicode card representations
- Color console support

## Missing Features / Issues

- There's currently no support for betting (including double and surrender) or splitting.
- [blackjack.py](blackjack.py) depends on readline.
  The readline functionality isn't critical, if you really want to run it on Windows you can just patch it out.
- The prompts currently assume the player is male. I'm keeping it as is for now because I appreciate the cabaret tone.
  Feel free to submit a PR if you have a suggestion. The prompts may be edited in [blackjack.py](blackjack.py).
